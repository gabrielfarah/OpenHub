{"name":"Openhub","tagline":"Bringing together code","body":"### Welcome to OpenHub.\r\nThere is currently a vast array of open source projects available on the web, and although they are searchable by name or description in the search engines, there is no way to search for projects by how well they perform on a given set of quality attributes (e.g. usability or maintainability). With OpenHub, we present a scalable and extensible architecture for the static and runtime analysis of open source repositories, initially written in Python. \r\n\r\n![Architecture overview](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/b685775c99bcbbae4e6f068e4279fe4376b441cf/68747470733a2f2f7261772e6769746875622e636f6d2f6761627269656c66617261682f4f70656e4875622f6d61737465722f646f63732f696d616765732f4f70656e4875625f4172636869746563747572652e706e67)\r\n\r\nMillions of repositories were analyzed using this architecture and Github platform. For these repositories, software quality metrics are calculated and stored in a mongodb setup (Check a base example [here](https://github.com/gabrielfarah/OpenHub/tree/master/examples)).\r\n\r\n## Why it matters?\r\nUsing the results from the analyzing process, researchers can perform comparative analysis over the quality metrics and developers can create cool stuff like firefox plugins to extend the github search results with the quality metrics. \r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nGabriel Farah Garcia (@gabrielfarah), Juan Tejada (@jstejada) and Dario Correal.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\ng.farah38@uniandes.edu.co","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
